# FPGA Development Projects – Digital Logic @ CMU

This repository contains a collection of FPGA projects and experiments developed as part of the Digital Logic course at Colorado Mesa University. All designs are implemented using **Quartus Prime** and deployed on the **DE10-Lite FPGA development board**.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to document the learning process of digital systems design using FPGAs.

## Repository Structure

This repository only includes the verilog files for the projects.

## Tools Used

- **Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition** – FPGA design suite
- **ModelSim** – Simulation and verification
- **DE10-Lite** – FPGA board with Intel MAX 10 chip

## Topics Covered

- Boolean logic and logic gates
- Combinational logic design
- Sequential logic (flip-flops, registers, counters)
- Finite State Machines (Moore/Mealy)
- Memory (RAM/ROM)
- Seven segment displays, switches, and LEDs I/O
- Clock division and timing
  
## Projects

- Reaction Timer
- Rock Paper Scissors game
- ThunderBird turn signals
