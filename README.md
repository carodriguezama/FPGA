# FPGA Development Projects – Digital Logic @ CMU

This repository contains a collection of FPGA projects and experiments developed as part of the Digital Logic course at Colorado Mesa University. All designs are implemented using **Quartus Prime** and deployed on the **DE10-Lite FPGA development board**.

## 🧠 Overview

The purpose of this repository is to document the learning process of digital systems design using FPGAs. Projects range from basic logic gates and combinational circuits to more complex sequential systems and finite state machines (FSMs).
